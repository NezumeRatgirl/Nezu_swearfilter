### This is a list of blocked terms that I use for a Discord community, blocking terms that have been, or may be used by specific members in that community, or by trolls.

The terms blocked are generally sexual, or intended to be provocative towards members of my community.
The phrases listed are used to flag a message, deleting it ect.
The phrases listed are to be used by Discord's in-built automod feature, each file representing a new swear list with a setup as follows:

Swear filters are split into 2 catagories; User and Novice+. server members are given the @User role after they successfully pass the entry channel (eg. doing the !agree command). Users gain a role after they've talked for a little while, and levelled up with a levelling bot (I use mee6), after which, they are given the @Novice role, which is the first rank role. 
The split is intended to catch new server members if they use specific phrases, typically used by trolls, to "filter" users, and restrict things like voice channels or other sensitive text channels, such as a selfie channel. After the user gains the @Novice role, or a higher rank, they are given a new, less strict, blocked phrases list.
