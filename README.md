### This is a list of blocked terms that I use for a Discord community, blocking terms that have been, or may be used by specific members in that community, or by trolls.

The blocked terms a user are generally sexual, or intended to be provocative towards members of my community.
The phrases listed are used to flag a message, deleting it ect.
The phrases listed are to be used by Discord's in-built automod feature, each file representing a new swear list with a setup as follows:

there are two timeout phrase lists, "New Users Timeout Phrases and "Novice+ Timeout Phrases". There is also a blocked phrases list, not used for timing out a user, called "Novice+ Timeout Phrases". Server members are given the @User role after they successfully pass the entry channel (eg. doing the !agree command). Users gain a role after they've talked for a little while, and levelled up with a levelling bot (I use mee6), after which, they are given the @Novice role, which is the first "level" role. 

The "New Users Timeout Phrases" list is a strict blocked phrases list to catch out trolls, and applys to people with the "@User" role (all server members without a "level" role eg. "@Novice"), and is blocked for the "@Novice" role and above (server members with a level).


The "Novice+ Timeout Phrases" list only applys to server members with the first "level" role (in this case the "@Novice" role), and is less strict, andis a list of phrases that will timemout a user when said in chat.

The "Novice+ Blocked Phrases" is a list of phrases that are blocked to all users with the first "level" role (in this case "@Novice"), or above.

There is also a "Watch & Act" phrases list, which notifies staff in a specific channel (in my case "#Staff- alerts") when a phrase is said by any server member with the "@Novice" level or above, but does not timeout the user, or remove the word. these phrases are phrases with double-meaning, and would be unreasonable to block, as it would restrict chat too much, but would still need to be monitored.

The blocked phrases lists being split for two roles is intended to catch new server members if they use specific phrases, typically used by trolls, to "filter" users. having seperate permissions for server members with the first "level" role is also recommended to restrict things like voice channels or other sensitive text channels, such as a selfie channel.



Please Note: it is recommended that you have a channel in your server for staff alerts/notifications (in my case, #staff-alerts), so staff can untimeout a user if they were timed-out unjustifiedly by the automod, which will can with the "New Users Timeout Phrases" from time-to-time, as it is a strict blocked phrases list.
If you have a phone that allows it eg. an android phone, I strongly recommend setting up notifications when a message is sent in the staff alerts/notifications chat.
